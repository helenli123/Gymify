# Gymify
This was a project created by computer science students at TAMS and submitted to the Creatica 2022, New York Cityâ€™s gender-focused hackathon for individuals in high school and college. It won 2nd place hack.

## Inspiration
As students aspiring to study computer science, we often find ourselves stuck to our chairs, hunched over our computers for hours on end. After extended periods of time spent like this, we have experienced not only premature back pain but also a decrease in energy levels and overall well-being. This is why we wanted to bring the gym to our own computer workspace - and that's how Gymify was born!

## What it does
Gymify is a motivating space that encourages people to get moving. It greets people and asks them to check in with how they're feeling, which is paired with personalized advice. Gymify also provides guides to stretching, a daily challenge, an upbeat music player, a selection of workout activities, and a place to reflect on their accomplishments.
